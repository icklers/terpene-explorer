### Theme Colors

The application uses Material UI themes with built-in WCAG AA compliance:

- **Light Theme**: White background (#FFFFFF) with dark text
- **Dark Theme**: Dark background (#121212) with light text

All Material UI default colors are designed to meet WCAG AA standards.

The dark theme enhances accessibility with:
- High contrast text (white on dark backgrounds)
- Clear visual hierarchy with floating cards
- Vibrant focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Distinct selection states with orange borders
- Consistent spacing and padding for readability

### Focus Indicators

The application implements clear, visible focus indicators that meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements:

1. **Keyboard Navigation Focus Ring**:
   - Uses vibrant orange (#ffb300) for high visibility
   - Applied to all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links, etc.)
   - Visible at 200% zoom level
   - Maintains shape and position-based indicators in addition to color

2. **Table Row Selection**:
   - Selected rows have a 4px vibrant orange (#ffb300) left border
   - Remains visible when users cannot distinguish colors
   - Combines with elevated background for multiple visual cues

3. **Toggle Button States**:
   - Active view mode highlighted with bright green (#4caf50)
   - Clear visual distinction between selected and unselected states
   - Consistent across all breakpoints

4. **Filter Chip Selection**:
   - Uses dual indicator pattern to prevent layout shift:
     - Background color (light elevated for selected, dark card surface for unselected)
     - Border color (effect-specific color for both states to prevent layout shift)
   - Selected chips have light elevated background (rgba(255,255,255,0.16)) with effect-specific border
   - Unselected chips have dark card surface background (#1e1e1e) with transparent border
   - Effect-specific colors enhance visual distinction between different effect categories
   - Color contrast maintained at 4.5:1 or higher for all text/background combinations

### Additional Accessibility Features

- ✅ ARIA live regions for search and filter results (T090)
- ✅ Focus management when switching views (T091)
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3) (T092)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Screen reader support with ARIA labels
- ✅ Skip links and focus indicators
- ✅ Semantic HTML throughout
- ✅ Responsive design that maintains accessibility at 200% zoom
- ✅ Color-independent indicators (shapes, positions) in addition to color
- ✅ Consistent visual language across all components

### Category Filters Accessibility

Category filters are implemented with accessibility in mind:

- Each filter chip has proper ARIA labels indicating state
- Clear visual distinction between selected and unselected states
- Keyboard operable with Space/Enter keys
- Screen reader announcements for selection changes
- Focus indicators visible on keyboard navigation
- Color contrast maintained at 4.5:1 or higher

**Keyboard Navigation**:
  - `Tab` → Move focus to next filter chip
  - `Shift+Tab` → Move focus to previous filter chip
  - `Space` or `Enter` → Toggle filter selection
  - `Esc` → Clear focus from filter controls

### Category Tabs Accessibility

Category tabs follow WAI-ARIA tab panel patterns:

- Proper `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, and `role="tabpanel"` roles
- Correct `aria-selected` and `aria-controls` attributes
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys
- Focus management when switching between categories

**Keyboard Navigation**:
  - `Tab` → Move focus to next category tab
  - `Shift+Tab` → Move focus to previous category tab
  - `Left/Right Arrow` → Navigate between category tabs
  - `Enter` or `Space` → Activate selected category
  - `Home/End` → Jump to first/last category tab

### Testing Verification

All accessibility features have been verified using:
- Chrome DevTools contrast ratio checker
- axe-core accessibility testing
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA
- Zoom testing at 200% magnification
- Color blindness simulation testing
