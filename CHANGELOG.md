### BREAKING CHANGE

* Manual tag creation no longer triggers releases.
The release process is now fully automated via semantic-release on pushes to main.

* chore(ci): update github-script action to v8

- Update actions/github-script from v7 to v8 in both PR validation and release workflows
- Ensures compatibility with latest GitHub Actions runtime

* chore(ci): avoid pushing to protected main by removing @semantic-release/git

* chore(ci): enable git pushes via GitHub App installation token; add token mint step to release workflow

* chore(ci): ensure App installation token is minted before semantic-release; add diagnostic/fallback logs
