# Interactive Terpene Map Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modern User Experience (UX)
The application MUST provide an intuitive, responsive, and accessible user interface. It SHOULD follow modern design principles (e.g., Material Design) for a clean and consistent look and feel. The interface MUST be performant, with fast load times and smooth interactions, targeting a broad range of devices.

### II. Component-Based Architecture
The application WILL be built using a component-based architecture. Components MUST be modular, reusable, and independently testable to promote separation of concerns and maintainability. State management SHALL be handled in a predictable and scalable manner.

### III. Static-First & Serverless
The application MUST be deployable as a static site (e.g., on GitHub Pages). Dynamic functionality SHALL be handled client-side or through serverless functions via API calls. This approach ensures scalability, security, and low operational overhead.

### IV. Security by Design
Security is a primary, non-negotiable concern. All external data sources and user inputs MUST be validated to prevent common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF). The application MUST use HTTPS for all network communication. No sensitive data shall be stored on the client-side.

### V. Comprehensive Testing
All new features MUST be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. A high level of test coverage is required to ensure code quality, correctness, and maintainability.

### VI. Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
The application MUST prioritize simplicity in design and implementation. Code should be easy to understand and maintain. Avoid unnecessary complexity and "clever" solutions that obscure intent.

### VII. You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
Functionality MUST NOT be added until it is deemed necessary. Avoid speculative features or over-engineering based on anticipated future needs.

### VIII. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
Code and logic SHOULD be reused wherever possible. Encapsulate common functionality into reusable components, functions, or modules to avoid duplication and improve maintainability.

## Development Workflow

All code changes MUST be introduced through Pull Requests (PRs) on GitHub. Each PR requires at least one approval from a team member other than the author. An automated Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline will run tests on every PR, and the build MUST pass before merging.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for project principles and practices. Any proposed amendments require a PR to this document, team discussion, and majority approval. All development activities, code reviews, and architectural decisions MUST align with this constitution.
