# Dark Theme Implementation - Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant dark theme system with floating card design as specified in feature 004-dark-theme-design. All requirements have been met and verified.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Theme Configuration
- Updated `src/theme/darkTheme.ts` with WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant color palette
- Implemented floating card design with 8px border radius
- Added effect-specific colors for filter chips with dual indicator pattern
- Configured responsive spacing (16px mobile, 32px desktop)

### 2. Component Updates
- **AppBar**: Sticky positioning with dark green (#388e3c) background and box-shadow
- **FilterControls**: Floating card styling with proper padding and spacing
- **ViewModeToggle**: Active state highlighting with bright green (#4caf50)
- **SearchBar**: Focus indicators with vibrant orange (#ffb300) border
- **TerpeneTable**: Zebra striping, hover states, and selection indicators
- **Home**: Responsive padding (16px mobile, 32px desktop)

### 3. Accessibility Enhancements
- Dual indicator pattern for filter chips to prevent layout shift
- Clear focus indicators with orange (#ffb300) for keyboard navigation
- Zebra striping for table rows with odd/even background differentiation
- Hover and selection states for improved interactivity feedback
- Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML throughout

### 4. Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests for theme configuration
- Created integration tests for all interactive components
- Verified WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance with automated testing
- Manual testing of zoom interface to 200% and mobile/desktop viewports

### 5. Documentation
- Updated `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` with new theme contrast ratios and focus indicators
- Created implementation summary and pull request template
