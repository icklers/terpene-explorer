# Specification Quality Checklist: Comfortably Dark Theme System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 26, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

### Content Quality Review

- ✅ Specification focuses on user experience and visual outcomes without mentioning React, TypeScript,
  Material-UI, or other implementation technologies
- ✅ All sections written in business-friendly language describing "what" not "how"
- ✅ User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria sections are complete with detailed content
- ✅ Color values and measurements provided as requirements, not implementation guidance

### Requirement Completeness Review

- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are fully specified
- ✅ All 15 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria (e.g., "System MUST apply
  dark green (#388e3c) as the background color for structural branding elements")
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics: "within 1 second", "100 milliseconds", "90% of users",
  "4.5:1 contrast ratio"
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details - focus on user-observable outcomes (e.g., "Users can
  identify the currently active view mode within 1 second" not "React state updates correctly")
- ✅ All 5 user stories include Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Edge cases section addresses 5 specific boundary conditions (browser compatibility, content overflow,
  zoom levels, print/export, accessibility modes)
- ✅ Scope boundaries clearly defined in "Out of Scope" section (theme switcher, animations, user
  customization, etc.)
- ✅ Dependencies and Assumptions sections populated with 8 assumptions and 4 dependencies

### Feature Readiness Review

- ✅ Each of the 15 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios prioritized (P1-P3) and cover the complete flow from initial theme display to advanced
  interactions (table scanning, filter chips)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and directly tie to user stories (reduced eye strain, quick
  identification of active elements, accessibility compliance)
- ✅ Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout - no leakage of component names, state
  management, or rendering details

## Notes

All checklist items passed on first validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for
the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`). No clarifications are needed as all color values, dimensions, and
behaviors are explicitly defined in the requirements.
