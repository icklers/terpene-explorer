# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Terpene Data Model with Detailed Info Display

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Content Quality Review
- **No implementation details**: ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without specifying HOW. Mentions Material UI in assumptions (acceptable) but doesn't dictate implementation approach.
- **User value focused**: ✅ All user stories clearly articulate user needs and value propositions.
- **Non-technical language**: ✅ Written in plain language accessible to business stakeholders.
- **Complete sections**: ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Review
- **No clarification markers**: ✅ All requirements are concrete and actionable without [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.
- **Testable requirements**: ✅ Each functional requirement can be verified through testing (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by verifying data source, FR-003 by clicking rows).
- **Measurable success criteria**: ✅ All success criteria include specific metrics (2 clicks, 500ms, 300ms, 360px, etc.).
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: ✅ Success criteria focus on user outcomes and performance metrics, not implementation details.
- **Defined scenarios**: ✅ Each user story has 3-4 Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios.
- **Edge cases identified**: ✅ 8 relevant edge cases documented covering data integrity, performance, security, and UX.
- **Clear scope**: ✅ Feature is bounded to: new data model integration, detail view, search bar relocation, and table column removal.
- **Dependencies/assumptions**: ✅ 10 assumptions documented including data format, browser requirements, and UI library usage.

### Feature Readiness Review
- **Clear acceptance criteria**: ✅ All 14 functional requirements are specific and verifiable.
- **Primary flows covered**: ✅ Three prioritized user stories cover the complete feature scope from P1 (core value) to P3 (UI enhancement).
- **Measurable outcomes**: ✅ 10 success criteria define clear benchmarks for feature completion.
- **Clean specification**: ✅ No implementation leakage; focuses on user needs and business value.

## Notes

All validation items passed on first review. The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`) or clarification if needed (`/speckit.clarify`).

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization with P1/P2/P3 labels on user stories
- Comprehensive edge case coverage including security (XSS), performance, and error handling
- Technology-agnostic success criteria with specific measurable values
- Well-defined data model understanding with detailed entity descriptions
- Independent testability clearly articulated for each user story

**No issues identified** - ready to proceed.
