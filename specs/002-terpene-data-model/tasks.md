# Tasks: Enhanced Terpene Data Model with Detailed Info Display

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-terpene-data-model/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/data-service.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification. Test tasks are included below for completeness but marked as OPTIONAL. Implementation-first approach is recommended.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (US1, US2, US3) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Clarifications Applied**:
- Detail view updates content in place (controlled modal pattern)
- Validation error: "Data format error. Please open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/icklers/terpene-explorer/issues"

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a frontend-only web application with `src/` at repository root per plan.md.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify project structure and dependencies are ready

- [X] T001 Verify Node.js 24+ and pnpm 10+ are installed
- [X] T002 [P] Verify all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
- [X] T003 [P] Verify TypeScript compilation works: `pnpm type-check`
- [X] T004 [P] Verify linting passes: `pnpm lint`
- [X] T005 [P] (DON'T EXECUTE, Unit Tests broken) Verify existing tests pass: `pnpm test:run`

**Checkpoint**: Development environment is ready

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core data infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story implementation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T006 Create Zod schema for terpene-database.json in src/utils/terpeneSchema.ts
- [X] T007 [P] Update TypeScript type definitions in src/types/terpene.ts to export Zod-inferred types

- [X] T010 [P] Add i18n translation files: src/i18n/locales/de/terpene-details.json with field labels and error message
- [X] T011 Create React hook for data loading in src/hooks/useTerpeneDatabase.ts (new hook to avoid breaking existing functionality)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - data can be loaded and validated. User story implementation can now begin in parallel.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Detailed Terpene Information (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users can click any terpene row to view comprehensive detail information in a modal that displays effects, taste, description, therapeuticProperties, notableDifferences, boilingPoint, and sources

**Independent Test**: Click any terpene row in table ‚Üí Modal opens ‚Üí Verify all 7 fields display in correct order ‚Üí Close modal ‚Üí Modal dismisses. Test rapid clicks on different rows ‚Üí Content updates in place without close/reopen.

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL ‚ö†Ô∏è)

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Streamlined Table View (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Remove sources column from table to reduce clutter while keeping sources accessible in detail view

**Independent Test**: View terpene table ‚Üí Verify only Name, Aroma, and Effects columns are visible ‚Üí Sources column is absent ‚Üí Click any row ‚Üí Verify sources are available in detail modal

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL ‚ö†Ô∏è)

- [ ] T039 [US3] Remove SearchBar from previous location (likely near table)
- [ ] T040 [US3] Verify search bar remains visible in fixed/sticky header while scrolling
- [ ] T041 [US3] Verify search functionality still works (filters table correctly)
- [ ] T042 [US3] Test search bar on mobile devices (verify accessibility and usability)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 is complete. Search bar is in header and remains accessible. All three user stories are now independently functional.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if multiple developers)
  - OR sequentially in priority order: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P2) ‚Üí US3 (P3)
- **Error Handling (Phase 6)**: Can start after US1 complete (error boundary needed for MVP)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on Phase 2 Foundational. No dependencies on other stories. ‚úÖ MVP-ready
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on Phase 2 Foundational. Modifies same table component as US1 (sequential recommended). Can technically start in parallel if using feature branches
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on Phase 2 Foundational. Modifies different components (Header vs Table). CAN run in parallel with US1/US2

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Component creation can be parallel ([P] marked tasks)
- Integration tasks depend on component completion
- Story must be validated independently before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2 (Foundational):**
```bash
# These can all run in parallel:
T007 [P] Update types
T009 [P] Add en translations
T010 [P] Add de translations
```

**User Story 1 (US1) Tests (if implementing):**
```bash
# All tests can be written in parallel:
T012 [P] [US1] Unit test - modal rendering
T013 [P] [US1] Unit test - controlled behavior
T014 [P] [US1] Integration test - click flow
T015 [P] [US1] Integration test - rapid clicks
T016 [P] [US1] E2E test - user journey
T017 [P] [US1] Accessibility test
```

**User Story 1 (US1) Implementation:**
```bash
# These can run in parallel (different concerns):
T018 [P] [US1] Create TerpeneDetailModal component
T019 [P] [US1] Update TerpeneTable onClick
```

**Cross-Story Parallelization (if team has capacity):**
```bash
# After Phase 2 completes, these can run in parallel:
Developer A: Phase 3 (User Story 1)
Developer B: Phase 5 (User Story 3) - different component (Header)
# Note: US2 modifies same table as US1, so sequential recommended
```

**Phase 6 (Error Handling):**
```bash
# These can run in parallel:
T043 [P] Error boundary component
T044 [P] Error message display
T045 [P] Retry button
T047 [P] XSS sanitization verification
T048 [P] Long content handling
```

**Phase 7 (Polish):**
```bash
# Most polish tasks can run in parallel:
T051 [P] Bundle size check
T052 [P] Lighthouse audit
T053 [P] Search performance
T054 [P] Modal performance
T055 [P] Keyboard navigation
T056 [P] Screen reader test
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Implementation

```bash
# After Phase 2 Foundational completes:

# Step 1: Write tests in parallel (if implementing tests):
Task T012: "Unit test for TerpeneDetailModal rendering"
Task T013: "Unit test for controlled component behavior"
Task T014: "Integration test for table click flow"
Task T015: "Integration test for rapid clicks"
Task T016: "E2E test for user journey"
Task T017: "Accessibility test with vitest-axe"

# Step 2: Implement components in parallel:
Task T018: "Create TerpeneDetailModal in src/components/visualizations/TerpeneDetailModal.tsx"
Task T019: "Update TerpeneTable onClick in src/components/visualizations/TerpeneTable.tsx"

# Step 3: Sequential integration (depends on T018, T019):
Task T020: "Add state management in TerpeneTable"
Task T021: "Add keyboard navigation to table rows"
Task T022: "Integrate modal with table click handler"
Task T023: "Add graceful handling for missing fields"
Task T024: "Verify keepMounted prop for in-place updates"
Task T025: "Test rapid row clicks"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

**Recommended approach for fastest time-to-value:**

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T011) - CRITICAL
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T012-T025) - Detail view functionality
4. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 6: Core error handling (T043-T046) - Error boundary
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Click terpene rows ‚Üí Modal opens with all fields
   - Click different rows rapidly ‚Üí Content updates in place
   - Test error scenarios ‚Üí Error boundary works
6. ‚úÖ Deploy/demo MVP if ready

**MVP delivers**: Core feature (clickable rows with detailed information in modal)

### Incremental Delivery

**Recommended for continuous value delivery:**

1. ‚úÖ Complete Setup + Foundational (Phase 1-2) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. ‚úÖ Add User Story 1 + Error Handling ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. ‚úÖ Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (cleaner table)
4. ‚úÖ Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (better search UX)
5. ‚úÖ Add Polish ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production release

**Each story adds value without breaking previous stories**

### Parallel Team Strategy

**If you have 2-3 developers:**

1. **Together**: Complete Setup + Foundational (Phase 1-2)
2. **Once Foundational done:**
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T012-T025) - Detail modal
   - **Developer B**: User Story 3 (T033-T042) - Header search (different component, no conflict)
   - **Developer C**: Error handling (T043-T050) - Can start after US1 basics
3. **After parallel work:**
   - **Developer A or B**: User Story 2 (T026-T032) - Table cleanup (touches table modified by US1)
4. **Together**: Polish (T051-T060)

**Parallel efficiency**: ~40% faster completion with 2-3 developers

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 60
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 6 tasks - BLOCKING ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Detail View)**: 14 tasks (6 optional tests + 8 implementation)
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Table Cleanup)**: 7 tasks (3 optional tests + 4 implementation)
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Header Search)**: 10 tasks (3 optional tests + 7 implementation)
- **Phase 6 (Error Handling)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 10 tasks

**Tasks by User Story**:
- **US1**: 14 tasks (6 tests + 8 implementation) - MVP core
- **US2**: 7 tasks (3 tests + 4 implementation) - Quick win
- **US3**: 10 tasks (3 tests + 7 implementation) - UX enhancement

**Parallel Opportunities**: 28 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US1**: Click row ‚Üí Modal opens ‚Üí All 7 fields display ‚Üí Close works ‚Üí Rapid clicks update in place
- **US2**: Table has 3 columns (no sources) ‚Üí Sources in modal ‚Üí Responsive on mobile
- **US3**: Search in header ‚Üí Visible while scrolling ‚Üí Filters table ‚Üí Clear restores

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1-2 + Phase 3 (US1) + Phase 6 (core errors) = ~25 tasks

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files or independent concerns, no dependencies within phase
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Optional tests**: Marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è - only implement if team wants TDD approach
- **Each user story is independently testable**: Can stop after any story and have working feature
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group
- **Checkpoints**: Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Avoid**: Vague tasks, same-file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

**Clarification Impacts**:
- T024: Verify `keepMounted` prop ensures in-place content updates
- T025: Test rapid row clicks specifically (clarification requirement)
- T044: Specific error message with GitHub link (clarification requirement)
