# Specification Quality Checklist: Therapeutic-Focused Terpene Details Modal

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Date**: 2025-10-31

### Strengths

1. **Clear User Focus**: The specification is written entirely from the medical cannabis patient perspective, with clear therapeutic value propositions
2. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 54 functional requirements cover all aspects of the modal (display, interactions, responsive, accessibility, performance)
3. **Well-Defined Success Criteria**: 12 measurable outcomes that are technology-agnostic and user-focused
4. **Prioritized User Stories**: 5 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P3) that are independently testable
5. **Thorough Edge Cases**: 9 edge cases covering boundary conditions and error scenarios
6. **Complete Context**: Assumptions, dependencies, and out-of-scope items clearly documented

### Areas Validated

- **No Implementation Leakage**: Specification avoids mentioning React, TypeScript, Material UI, or specific component names (these are appropriately in the separate implementation documents)
- **Testable Requirements**: Each FR can be verified through user testing or automated testing without knowing implementation details
- **Measurable Success**: All SC items include specific metrics (time, percentage, score) that can be tracked
- **Clear Scope Boundaries**: Out of Scope section explicitly lists 10 features not included, preventing scope creep

### Quality Score

- Content Quality: 4/4 ✅
- Requirement Completeness: 8/8 ✅
- Feature Readiness: 4/4 ✅

**Total: 16/16 (100%)**

## Notes

- The specification successfully separates **WHAT** (requirements) from **HOW** (implementation)
- The UX design documents (`.idea/terpene-modal-ux-spec-v2.md` and `.idea/terpene-modal-context-grouping.md`) serve as complementary design references but are not part of the formal specification
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and unambiguous
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase

## Recommendation

✅ **APPROVED FOR PLANNING**

This specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the planning phase. The feature can be broken down into implementation tasks based on the prioritized user stories.
