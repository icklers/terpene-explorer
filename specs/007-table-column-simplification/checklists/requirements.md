# Specification Quality Checklist: Table Column Simplification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase.

### Specification Highlights:

- **Clear Scope**: Four-column table layout (Name, Aroma, Effects, Category) with Sources column removed
- **Default Behavior**: Category-based sorting with secondary alphabetical sorting by name
- **Edge Cases**: Handled missing/invalid categories with sensible defaults
- **Success Criteria**: All measurable and technology-agnostic (performance targets, layout constraints, interaction preservation)
- **User Stories**: Three prioritized stories (P1: simplified layout, P1: category sorting, P2: flexible column sorting)
- **Internationalization**: Bilingual support maintained for all labels

The specification avoids all implementation details while providing clear, testable requirements that can guide development.
