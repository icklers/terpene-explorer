# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Interactive Terpene Map, a dynamic, filterable, and visually engaging educational tool. The application will be built using React, D3.js, and Tailwind CSS, and will be deployable as a static website.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES2022)
**Primary Dependencies**: React, D3.js, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: N/A (data from file)
**Testing**: Jest, Playwright, React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Performance Goals**: Lighthouse score > 90, interactions < 200ms
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA
**Scale/Scope**: Up to 500 terpenes

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [X] **Modern UX**: Does the plan account for a responsive, accessible, and intuitive UI?
- [X] **Component-Based Architecture**: Is the feature broken down into modular, reusable components?
- [X] **Static-First & Serverless**: Does the architecture adhere to static site generation and serverless principles?
- [X] **Security by Design**: Are security considerations (input validation, data protection) integrated into the plan?
- [X] **Comprehensive Testing**: Does the plan include tasks for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing?
- [X] **KISS**: Does the plan favor simplicity and avoid over-engineering?
- [X] **YAGNI**: Does the plan avoid implementing features that aren't immediately necessary?
- [X] **DRY**: Does the plan promote code reuse and avoid duplication?

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

```
specs/[###-feature]/
├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)
├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)
├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)
└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)
```

### Source Code (repository root)

```
# Web application
src/
├── components/
├── pages/
└── services/

tests/
├── contract/
├── integration/
└── unit/
```

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a standard web application structure with a `src` directory for the application code and a `tests` directory for the tests. The `src` directory will be further divided into `components`, `pages`, and `services`.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
