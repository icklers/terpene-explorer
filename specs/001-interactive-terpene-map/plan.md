# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The project is to create an interactive terpene map from static data files. The application will be a single-page application with features like filtering, searching, different data visualizations (sunburst chart, table), theme switching, and localization.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES2022)
**Primary Dependencies**: React, D3.js, Tailwind CSS, Jest, Playwright, React Testing Library
**Storage**: N/A (static files)
**Testing**: Jest, Playwright, React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web (modern browsers)
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Fast initial load (<2s), instant interactions (<200ms)
**Constraints**: Static site, no backend
**Scale/Scope**: Small to medium dataset of terpenes

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Modern UX**: Does the plan account for a responsive, accessible, and intuitive UI?
- [x] **Component-Based Architecture**: Is the feature broken down into modular, reusable components?
- [x] **Static-First & Serverless**: Does the architecture adhere to static site generation and serverless principles?
- [x] **Security by Design**: Are security considerations (input validation, data protection) integrated into the plan?
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing**: Does the plan include tasks for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing?
- [x] **KISS**: Does the plan favor simplicity and avoid over-engineering?
- [x] **YAGNI**: Does the plan avoid implementing features that aren't immediately necessary?
- [x] **DRY**: Does the plan promote code reuse and avoid duplication?

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
