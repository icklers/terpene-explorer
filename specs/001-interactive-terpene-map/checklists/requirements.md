# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Terpene Map

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](./spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Technical constraints moved to separate section
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs - User stories and requirements focus on outcomes
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language is accessible, technical details isolated
- [X] All mandatory sections completed - Clarifications, User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All clarifications resolved in Sessions 2025-10-18 and 2025-10-23
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - All FRs have clear MUST/SHALL statements
- [X] Success criteria are measurable - All SCs have specific metrics (Lighthouse scores, time targets, percentages)
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - SCs focus on user outcomes, not tech
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined - 3 user stories with 10 total acceptance scenarios
- [X] Edge cases are identified - 6 edge cases documented (load failure, invalid data, empty dataset, etc.)
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded - Out of scope section defines exclusions (user accounts, SSR)
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Data volume (500 terpenes), performance targets, accessibility standards

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 16 FRs map to user stories with acceptance scenarios
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows - 3 user stories (P1: filtering/search/viz, P2: theming/i18n)
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 6 success criteria with quantifiable targets
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification - Tech constraints isolated in dedicated section

## Notes

- **2025-10-18**: Initial specification created with sunburst chart, table view, and search bar requirements
- **2025-10-23**: Added 5 clarifications (FR-013 through FR-016) for performance targets, AND/OR filtering, localStorage persistence, graceful validation, and empty state handling
- **2025-10-23**: Checklist validated - all 21 items verified and checked âœ“
