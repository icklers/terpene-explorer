# Quickstart

This guide will help you set up and run the Interactive Terpene Map project locally.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd interactive-terpene-map/frontend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building the Application

To create a production build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build

```

This will create a `build` directory with the static files that can be deployed to a hosting provider.
