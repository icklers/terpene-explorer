# Tasks: Bilingual Terpene Data Support

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-bilingual-data-support/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included following TDD (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR) approach as specified in plan.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by TDD cycles aligned with user stories to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Single-page web application with Vite
- Frontend: `src/` at repository root
- Tests: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`
- Data: `data/` at repository root

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
  - TDD Cycle 1: Translation File Loading (T007-T016)
  - TDD Cycle 2: Translation Cache (T017-T023)
- **User Story 1 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational completion
  - TDD Cycle 3: Translation Merging (T024-T033)
  - TDD Cycle 4: Translation Service (T034-T045)
  - TDD Cycle 6: React Hook (T046-T055)
  - Component Integration (T056-T059)
  - Tests (T060-T065)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs translation infrastructure)
  - TDD Cycle 7: UI Components (T066-T076)
  - Component Integration (T077-T080)
  - TDD Cycle 10: Accessibility (T086-T093)
  - Tests (T081-T085)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs translation service)
  - TDD Cycle 5: Search (T094-T106)
  - Component Integration (T107-T111)
  - Tests (T112-T119)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 completion (validates entire system)
  - Validation and Optimization (T120-T131)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories

### TDD Cycle Flow (Critical for All Phases)

**EVERY cycle MUST follow this order**:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests FIRST
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to make tests PASS
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests GREEN
4. **VERIFY**: Run all tests to ensure nothing broke

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written first and FAIL before implementation (RED phase)
- Unit tests before integration tests before E2E tests
- Core service layer before component integration
- Story complete and tested before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 Setup**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002, T003, T004, T005, T006)
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: Test writing within each TDD cycle can be parallelized (T007-T008, T017)
- **Phase 4 US1**: Test writing can be parallelized (T024-T025, T034, T046)
- **Phase 5 US2**: Test writing can be parallelized (T066-T067, T086)
- **Phase 6 US3**: Test writing can be parallelized (T094-T095)
- **Phase 7 US4**: Performance tests can run in parallel (T120-T121)
- **Phase 8 Polish**: Documentation tasks can run in parallel (T132-T135)

### Strict TDD Workflow Per Cycle

```
Example: TDD Cycle 3 (Translation Merging)

1. RED Phase:
   - T024: Write merge tests (MUST FAIL)
   - T025: Write helper tests (MUST FAIL)
   - Verify: Run tests, confirm failures

2. GREEN Phase:
   - T026: Implement mergeTerpeneTranslation
   - T027: Implement status calculation
   - T028: Implement helper functions
   - T029: Run tests (MUST PASS)
   - Verify: All tests green

3. REFACTOR Phase:
   - T030: Extract field iteration
   - T031: Improve type inference
   - T032: Add JSDoc
   - T033: Run tests (MUST STAY GREEN)
   - Verify: All tests still green
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# TDD Cycle 3 - RED Phase (can run in parallel):
Task T024: "Write merge tests in tests/unit/services/translationService.test.ts"
Task T025: "Write helper tests in tests/unit/utils/translationHelpers.test.ts"

# TDD Cycle 4 - RED Phase:
Task T034: "Write TranslationService integration tests"

# TDD Cycle 6 - RED Phase:
Task T046: "Write useTerpeneTranslation hook tests"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only) - TDD Foundation

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (TDD Cycles 1-2)
   - **CRITICAL**: Each cycle MUST complete RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR
   - Verify all foundational tests are GREEN before proceeding
3. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1 (TDD Cycles 3-4-6)
   - Each cycle: Write tests FIRST (RED), implement (GREEN), refactor (REFACTOR)
   - Verify all US1 tests are GREEN
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### TDD Quality Gates

**After Each TDD Cycle**:
- ‚úÖ All tests written in RED phase exist and initially failed
- ‚úÖ All tests pass in GREEN phase
- ‚úÖ All tests remain passing after REFACTOR phase
- ‚úÖ No tests skipped or disabled
- ‚úÖ Code coverage meets targets (80%+ for critical paths)

**After Each User Story**:
- ‚úÖ All story tests passing (unit + integration + E2E)
- ‚úÖ Accessibility tests passing (vitest-axe)
- ‚úÖ Independent test criteria verified
- ‚úÖ No regressions in previous stories

### Incremental Delivery (TDD-Driven)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (TDD Cycles 1-2) ‚Üí Foundation ready, tests GREEN
2. Add User Story 1 (TDD Cycles 3-4-6) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí All tests GREEN ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (TDD Cycle 7 + 10) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí All tests GREEN ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (TDD Cycle 5) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí All tests GREEN ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (Validation) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí All tests GREEN ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories (test suite verifies)

### Parallel Team Strategy (TDD-Aware)

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (TDD Cycles 1-2)
   - Pair programming on TDD cycles recommended for alignment
2. Once Foundational is done (all tests GREEN):
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (TDD Cycles 3-4-6)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (TDD Cycles 7 + 10) - waits for US1 foundation
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (TDD Cycle 5) - waits for US1 foundation
3. Each developer follows RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR strictly
4. Stories complete independently with test suites GREEN

---

## Notes

- **TDD is MANDATORY**: All code must have tests written FIRST (RED phase)
- **Test Failures are REQUIRED**: Tests must fail before implementation (RED phase)
- **Tests Must Pass**: Implementation must make all tests pass (GREEN phase)
- **Refactoring is SAFE**: Tests enable confident code improvements (REFACTOR phase)
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each TDD cycle (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Never skip RED phase** - tests define behavior before implementation
- **Never skip REFACTOR phase** - code quality matters
- **Test suite is documentation** - tests describe exact expected behavior
