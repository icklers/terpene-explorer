# Specification Update Log: Feature 005

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Reason**: Post-merge adaptation for feature 006 (bilingual data support)  
**Branch**: `005-table-filter-bar`

## Update Summary

The specification has been updated to reflect the integration context with feature 006 (bilingual
data support), which was merged into this branch. **No functional requirements were changed** - only
clarifications were added to acknowledge the bilingual infrastructure now available.

## Changes Made

### 1. Header Section Updates

**Added**:

- Update date: "2025-10-31 (post feature 006 merge)"
- Context note explaining that feature 006 provides data model infrastructure and bilingual search
  capabilities
- Clarification that filter implementation must integrate with TranslationSearchService

**Purpose**: Provides context for developers about the bilingual environment the filter operates in.

### 2. Edge Cases Section

**Added**:

- New edge case: "Bilingual search integration"
- Explains that when UI language is German, users can search using either German or English terms
- Notes coordination with TranslationSearchService while maintaining performance targets

**Purpose**: Documents expected behavior in bilingual mode without changing functional requirements.

### 3. Functional Requirements

**Added**:

- **FR-006a**: Cross-language search requirement when bilingual mode is active
- **FR-024**: Integration requirement with TranslationSearchService for German language mode

**Purpose**: Explicitly states coordination requirements with feature 006 infrastructure.

### 4. Key Entities Section

**Modified**:

- **Filter Criteria**: Added note about language (English or German)
- **Filterable Attributes**: Added note about bilingual searchability
- **TranslationSearchService**: Added as new entity to document coordination point

**Purpose**: Clarifies entities involved in bilingual filtering without changing core functionality.

### 5. Success Criteria

**Modified**:

- **SC-004**: Added "(in either English or German)" to clarify bilingual context
- **SC-005**: Added "(using terminology in their selected language)" for clarity

**Purpose**: Success criteria now explicitly acknowledge bilingual capability.

### 6. Assumptions Section

**Modified**:

- Verified that taste and therapeuticProperties fields exist (from feature 006 merge)
- Added three new assumptions about feature 006's bilingual infrastructure:
  - TranslationSearchService availability
  - German user expectations for German terminology search
  - i18n infrastructure for placeholder text updates

**Purpose**: Documents the changed baseline environment post-merge.

## What Was NOT Changed

### Preserved Elements

1. **All User Stories**: No changes to user stories or acceptance scenarios
2. **Core Functional Requirements**: FR-001 through FR-023 remain unchanged
3. **Success Criteria metrics**: Performance targets, user completion rates, etc. remain the same
4. **Implementation approach**: Still extends existing filter functionality
5. **Priority levels**: All P1/P2 priorities unchanged

### Rationale

The feature 005 specification describes **what** the filter bar extension should do from a user
perspective. The integration with feature 006's bilingual infrastructure is an **implementation
detail** about **how** to achieve those requirements in the new bilingual environment.

The updates clarify:

- **Context**: The filter now operates in a bilingual environment
- **Coordination**: Must work with TranslationSearchService
- **Expectations**: Users can search in their language

But they do **not** change:

- **What** users can do (filter by name, effect, aroma, taste, therapeutic properties)
- **How** it should behave (real-time, debounced, case-insensitive, etc.)
- **Performance** targets (<100ms filter operation, <400ms perceived latency)
- **UX** requirements (placeholder text, location, labeling)

## Validation

The updated specification still passes all quality criteria:

- ✅ No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- ✅ Focused on user value and business needs
- ✅ Written for non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections completed
- ✅ Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ All acceptance scenarios are defined
- ✅ Edge cases are identified (now including bilingual case)
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions identified (updated for feature 006)

## Impact on Implementation

### For Developers

The clarifications help developers understand that:

1. The data model already has the required fields (taste, therapeuticProperties)
2. A bilingual search service exists and should be leveraged
3. Cross-language search is expected when UI is in German
4. Integration with TranslationSearchService is required, not optional

### For Planning

The plan.md and tasks.md files should be updated to reflect:

1. Some foundational tasks are already complete (data model verification)
2. New integration tasks needed (coordination with TranslationSearchService)
3. Testing should cover both English-only and bilingual search modes
4. Performance benchmarks must account for bilingual search overhead

See `.idea/005-feature-006-merge-implications.md` for detailed implementation guidance.

## Review Status

- **Specification Review**: ✅ Complete - maintains functional requirements while adding context
- **Technical Review**: ⚠️ Pending - requires review of TranslationSearchService integration
  strategy
- **Planning Update**: ⚠️ Pending - tasks.md should be updated per implications document

## Next Steps

1. Review the updated specification with stakeholders
2. Update tasks.md based on `.idea/005-feature-006-merge-implications.md`
3. Update plan.md to reflect completed foundational work
4. Proceed with implementation using hybrid approach (delegate to TranslationSearchService in German
   mode)

**Document Purpose**: This log explains what was changed in the specification and why, providing
transparency for the update process and guidance for implementation.
