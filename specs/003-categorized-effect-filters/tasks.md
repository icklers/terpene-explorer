# Tasks: Categorized Effect Filters

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-categorized-effect-filters/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/component-contracts.md, quickstart.md

**Feature**: Enable users to filter terpenes by therapeutic effect categories (Mood, Cognitive, Relaxation, Physical) with visual grouping, color coding, emoticons, and category-level filtering.

**Tests**: E2E tests are included as they are specified in the feature requirements (accessibility, mobile responsiveness).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and verification of prerequisites

- [ ] T001 Verify database schema includes effectCategories and effectCategoryMapping in data/terpene-database.json
- [ ] T002 Verify Zod schemas exported from src/utils/terpeneSchema.ts (EffectCategory, EffectCategoryMapping types)
- [ ] T003 [P] Run pnpm type-check to ensure TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] T004 [P] Verify Material UI 6.3+ and Emotion 11.13+ are available in package.json

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T005 Create CATEGORY_UI_CONFIG constant in src/utils/categoryUIConfig.ts with emoticons, fallback letters, and ARIA labels for all 4 categories
- [ ] T006 [P] Add category color tokens to src/theme/lightTheme.ts (category.mood, category.cognitive, category.relaxation, category.physical)
- [ ] T007 [P] Add category color tokens to src/theme/darkTheme.ts with appropriate contrast for dark mode
- [ ] T008 Extend TypeScript theme types in src/theme/themeConfig.ts to include category palette interface

- [ ] T010 Update useFilters hook in src/hooks/useFilters.ts to initialize categoryFilters as empty array in localStorage
- [ ] T011 Create applyEffectFilters function in src/services/filterService.ts with OR/AND logic for category and effect filters
- [ ] T012 Create syncCategoryFilters function in src/services/filterService.ts to auto-deselect categories when effects cleared
- [ ] T013 [P] Run pnpm type-check to verify all foundational changes compile without errors

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Categorized Effects (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Display effect filters organized into 4 therapeutic categories with emoticons, enabling users to quickly identify which category addresses their therapeutic needs.

**Independent Test**: Open effect filter interface and verify effects are visually grouped into categories (Mood & Energy ‚ö°, Cognitive & Mental Enhancement üß†, Relaxation & Anxiety Management üòå, Physical & Physiological Management üí™) in correct order. Each category displays emoticon and effects are correctly grouped (4 mood, 4 cognitive, 5 relaxation, 6 physical).

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Create CategoryEmoticon component in src/components/filters/CategoryEmoticon.tsx with canvas-based emoticon detection and fallback letter rendering
- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Create CategoryFilterGroup component skeleton in src/components/filters/CategoryFilterGroup.tsx (desktop layout only, no accordion yet)

- [ ] T022 [P] [US1] Add E2E test case to verify emoticons display or fallback letters render correctly
- [ ] T023 [P] [US1] Add E2E test case to verify effects are grouped correctly (4 mood, 4 cognitive, 5 relaxation, 6 physical)
- [ ] T024 [P] [US1] Add E2E test case to verify category display order: Mood ‚Üí Cognitive ‚Üí Relaxation ‚Üí Physical

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - users can see categorized effects with emoticons (no filtering yet)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Visual Category Distinction via Color Coding (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Apply distinct colors to each category so users can quickly identify therapeutic categories at a glance, with WCAG 2.1 AA contrast compliance.

- [ ] T031 [P] [US2] Add test case to verify emoticons have proper ARIA labels ("Mood and Energy category" not "high voltage sign")

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - categories are visually distinct with accessible colors

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Individual Effect Color Coding (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Apply category colors to individual effect filter chips so users can recognize therapeutic categories when interacting with filters.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Category-Level Filtering (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to filter terpenes by entire categories (e.g., "show only Mood & Energy effects") with OR logic for multiple categories and auto-sync when individual effects are deselected.

**Independent Test**: Select "Mood & Energy" category and verify only terpenes with mood effects display. Select multiple categories and verify OR logic (union of results). Deselect all individual effects in a category and verify category auto-deselects.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T041 [US4] Add toggleCategoryFilter method to useFilters hook in src/hooks/useFilters.ts

- [ ] T053 [P] [US4] Create unit test in tests/unit/hooks/useFilters.test.ts to verify toggleCategoryFilter adds/removes categories
- [ ] T054 [P] [US4] Add test case to verify toggleEffectFilter calls syncCategoryFilters

### Integration Tests for User Story 4

- [ ] T055 [P] [US4] Create integration test in tests/integration/us4-category-filter-flow.test.tsx to verify category selection filters terpenes
- [ ] T056 [P] [US4] Add test case to verify combining category and effect filters uses OR logic

---

## Phase 7: Mobile Responsiveness (FR-013)

**Goal**: Implement collapsible accordions on mobile screens (320px-480px) where users tap category headers to expand/collapse content.

**Independent Test**: Open app on mobile viewport (375px width), verify categories render as collapsed accordions. Tap category header and verify content expands. Verify category checkbox visible in accordion header.

### Implementation for Mobile

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P2 for US4)
- **Mobile Responsiveness (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Story 1 (CategoryFilterGroup component exists)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories and mobile implementation being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 (CategoryFilterGroup component exists to apply colors)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 1 (CategoryFilterGroup component exists to color effect chips)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Filter logic functions exist independently of UI
- **Mobile (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Story 1 (CategoryFilterGroup component exists to wrap in accordion)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T013) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T014-T024)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently - users can see categorized effects with emoticons
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Deliverable**: Effect filters organized into 4 categories with emoticons - no filtering yet, just improved organization and discoverability.

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. **Setup + Foundational** (T001-T013) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. **Add User Story 1** (T014-T024) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo (MVP!)** - Categorized effect display with emoticons
3. **Add User Story 2** (T025-T031) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo - Color coding for quick visual identification
4. **Add User Story 4** (T041-T061) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo - Category-level filtering functionality
5. **Add User Story 3** (T032-T040) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo - Individual effect chip color coding
6. **Add Mobile** (T062-T072) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo - Mobile accordion UI
7. **Polish** (T073-T091) ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production release

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T013)
2. **Once Foundational is done**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T014-T024) - MVP
   - Developer B: User Story 4 filter logic (T041-T047) - Can start in parallel with US1
   - Developer C: Theme setup for US2 (T006-T007 already done in Foundational)
3. **After User Story 1 complete**:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (T025-T031) - Color coding
   - Developer B: User Story 4 tests (T048-T061)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T032-T040) - Effect chip colors
4. **After core stories complete**:
   - Developer A: Mobile (T062-T072)
   - Developer B: Accessibility (T073-T077)
   - Developer C: Performance (T078-T083)
5. **Final**: Documentation and validation together (T084-T091)

Stories complete and integrate independently.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- E2E tests verify end-to-end user journeys per requirement FR-013 (mobile) and Success Criteria SC-003 to SC-010
- Unit/integration tests verify filter logic correctness per FR-016, FR-017, FR-020
- Accessibility tests verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance per FR-006 and Success Criteria SC-004, SC-006
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
