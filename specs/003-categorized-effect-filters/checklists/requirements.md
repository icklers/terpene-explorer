# Specification Quality Checklist: Categorized Effect Filters

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 25, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - All quality criteria met (Updated: October 25, 2025)

### Recent Updates

- Added reference to `docs/effect-categorization.md` for category definitions
- Added Material emoticon requirements for each category (âš¡ðŸ§ ðŸ˜ŒðŸ’ª)
- Updated category names to match documentation (e.g., "Mood & Energy" instead of "Energy")
- Added emoticon-related functional requirements (FR-004, FR-012)
- Added emoticon accessibility and rendering considerations to edge cases and success criteria
- Added browser compatibility success criterion (SC-008)

### Detailed Assessment

#### Content Quality Review

- âœ… **No implementation details**: Specification describes WHAT and WHY without mentioning specific technologies (React, TypeScript, etc.)
- âœ… **User value focused**: All requirements trace back to medical cannabis user needs for therapeutic effect discovery
- âœ… **Non-technical language**: Uses plain language understandable by product managers and medical professionals
- âœ… **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions) are fully populated

#### Requirement Quality Review

- âœ… **No clarification markers**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- âœ… **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be independently verified (e.g., FR-002 "display in fixed order" is objectively testable)
- âœ… **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics (2 seconds, 95%, 30%, 40%, zero violations, 320px-2560px range)
- âœ… **Technology-agnostic SC**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation (e.g., "users can identify" vs "React renders")
- âœ… **Complete scenarios**: 16 total acceptance scenarios across 3 prioritized user stories
- âœ… **Edge cases identified**: 5 edge cases documented covering extensibility, accessibility, responsive design, consistency, and future
  customization
- âœ… **Clear scope boundaries**: Out of Scope section explicitly defines 6 non-goals to prevent scope creep
- âœ… **Dependencies documented**: 4 dependencies identified with specific references (PR #30, FilterControls.tsx, Material UI, WCAG 2.1)

#### Feature Readiness Assessment

- âœ… **FR acceptance criteria**: All 10 functional requirements map to specific user story scenarios and are independently verifiable
- âœ… **Primary flow coverage**: 3 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) provide incremental value delivery from basic grouping to full color
  coding
- âœ… **SC alignment**: Success criteria directly measure the feature goals (identification speed, accuracy, time reduction, accessibility,
  satisfaction)
- âœ… **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains abstraction - mentions existing components by name only as context, not
  implementation direction

### Specification Strengths

1. **Clear prioritization**: User stories are prioritized (P1-P3) with explicit value justification for each priority level
2. **Independent testability**: Each user story can be implemented and tested independently, supporting iterative delivery
3. **Accessibility first**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance is a hard requirement, not an afterthought
4. **Measurable outcomes**: All 7 success criteria include quantitative metrics or objective verification methods
5. **Well-bounded scope**: 19 effects, 4 categories, fixed order - no ambiguity about what's included
6. **Realistic assumptions**: 6 assumptions documented with references to existing artifacts (EFFECT_CATEGORIZATION.md, FilterControls.tsx)

### Ready for Next Phase

âœ… **Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`**

This specification provides sufficient detail for technical planning without prescribing implementation approaches. All requirements are
clear, testable, and focused on user value.

## Notes

- Category color selection will be handled during planning phase based on existing Material UI palette and WCAG 2.1 contrast validation
- Effect-to-category mapping is already defined in EFFECT_CATEGORIZATION.md and referenced in FR-003 for consistency
- No further clarifications needed - specification is actionable as written
