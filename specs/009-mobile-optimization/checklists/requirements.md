- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✅

**No implementation details**: PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- User scenarios describe behaviors, not code structure
- Requirements specify outcomes, not technical approaches

**Focused on user value**: PASS
- All user stories explain value proposition clearly
- Success criteria tied to user satisfaction and business metrics
- Requirements prioritized by user impact

**Written for non-technical stakeholders**: PASS
- Plain language throughout
- Technical constraints documented separately
- User-centric terminology used

**All mandatory sections completed**: PASS
- User Scenarios & Testing: Complete with 5 prioritized stories
- Requirements: Complete with 87 functional requirements
- Success Criteria: Complete with 32 measurable outcomes
- All optional sections appropriately filled

### Requirement Completeness ✅

**No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: PASS
- Zero clarification markers in specification
- All decisions informed by design brief
- Reasonable defaults chosen based on industry standards

**Requirements testable and unambiguous**: PASS
- Each requirement uses "MUST" with specific, measurable criteria
- Clear acceptance scenarios for each user story
- No vague or subjective requirements

**Success criteria measurable**: PASS
- Specific metrics defined (percentages, durations, counts)
- Baseline and target values specified
- Time-bound where appropriate

**Success criteria technology-agnostic**: PASS
- No mention of frameworks or libraries
- Focus on user-observable outcomes
- Performance metrics from user perspective

**All acceptance scenarios defined**: PASS
- 28 acceptance scenarios across 5 user stories
- Given-When-Then format consistently used
- Scenarios cover main flows and variations

**Edge cases identified**: PASS
- 8 edge cases documented
- Each with clear expected behavior
- Covers device variations, network issues, accessibility

**Scope clearly bounded**: PASS
- In-scope items explicitly listed
- Out-of-scope section comprehensive (38 items)
- Dependencies clearly identified

**Dependencies and assumptions identified**: PASS
- 18 external/internal dependencies documented
- 36 assumptions across 6 categories
- Constraints section with 60 items

### Feature Readiness ✅

**All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: PASS
- 87 functional requirements defined
- Each mapped to user stories or success criteria
- Clear pass/fail criteria for testing

**User scenarios cover primary flows**: PASS
- 5 user stories prioritized P1-P5
- Core mobile browsing (P1), filtering (P2), navigation (P3) covered
- Secondary features (PWA, gestures) appropriately prioritized

**Feature meets measurable outcomes**: PASS
- 32 success criteria align with 87 functional requirements
- Metrics span usability, engagement, performance, accessibility, quality, adoption
- All success criteria verifiable without implementation knowledge

**No implementation details leak**: PASS
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic language
- Functional requirements describe behaviors, not code
- Constraints section appropriately separates technical details

## Notes

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive coverage**: Specification thoroughly addresses mobile optimization from multiple angles
2. **Well-structured prioritization**: User stories prioritized by value with clear independent test criteria
3. **Strong accessibility focus**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements woven throughout
4. **Clear boundaries**: Out-of-scope section prevents scope creep
5. **Risk awareness**: Comprehensive risk assessment with mitigation strategies
6. **Informed decisions**: Design brief provided excellent foundation for specification

### Based on Design Brief

- All design objectives from brief incorporated into functional requirements
- Performance standards (Lighthouse, FCP, LCP, TTI) directly mapped to success criteria
- Touch interaction standards (44x44px minimum) enforced throughout
- UI patterns (cards, modals, bottom sheets, FAB) specified as entities
- Three-phase delivery approach reflected in user story prioritization

### Markdown Linting Notes

The spec.md file has 64 markdown formatting issues (MD013 line length, MD036 emphasis as heading, MD032 blank lines, MD009 trailing spaces). These are **style/formatting preferences** that do not affect specification quality, content accuracy, or completeness. The specification content itself passes all quality criteria.

- Line length violations are in acceptance scenarios and entity descriptions
- Risk labels use bold emphasis instead of heading syntax
- Some list formatting has minor spacing variations
- One trailing space detected

**Impact**: None on specification validity. These can be addressed during formatting passes but do not block planning or development.

### Ready for Next Phase

✅ **APPROVED FOR PLANNING**

This specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` to create the technical implementation plan.

**Specification Content Quality**: ✅ All criteria met  
**Markdown Formatting**: ⚠️ 64 style issues (non-blocking)

No clarifications needed - all decisions made using:

- Industry standards (WCAG 2.1 AA, 44x44px touch targets)
- Mobile best practices (bottom sheets, swipe gestures, 60fps animations)
- Progressive web app conventions (service workers, manifest, offline)
- Material Design 3 patterns (FAB, navigation drawer, modal presentations)
- Existing project context (React 19.2, Material UI 6.3, dark theme, bilingual support)
