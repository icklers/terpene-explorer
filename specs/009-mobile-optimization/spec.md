# Feature Specification: Mobile Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `009-mobile-optimization`  
**Created**: 2025-11-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The app requires to be usable on mobile. Transform Terpene Explorer from a desktop-first web application into a best-in-class mobile experience that rivals native applications, addressing critical mobile usability issues while maintaining the existing desktop experience."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Quick Terpene Lookup on Mobile (Priority: P1)

A mobile user wants to quickly look up a specific terpene while on the go, view its key properties in an easy-to-read format, and share the information with someone.

**Why this priority**: This is the most common use case for mobile users and represents the core value proposition. Without this working smoothly, the app has no mobile viability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the app on a mobile device, searching for a terpene, viewing its details in a card format without horizontal scrolling, and using the native share feature to share the information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens app on smartphone (360-430px width), **When** they view the terpene list, **Then** all content fits within viewport width with no horizontal scrolling required
2. **Given** user browses terpene list, **When** they tap any terpene card, **Then** card provides visual feedback within 100ms and all touch targets are minimum 44x44px
3. **Given** user views terpene card, **When** they read the information, **Then** terpene name, aroma, and top 3 effects are clearly visible without expanding
4. **Given** user taps a terpene card, **When** detail modal opens, **Then** it slides up from bottom in under 300ms and displays in full-screen on mobile
5. **Given** user views terpene details in modal, **When** they swipe down from top, **Then** modal closes smoothly and returns to previous view
6. **Given** user wants to share terpene information, **When** they tap share button in detail modal, **Then** native mobile share dialog appears with app-appropriate content

---

### User Story 2 - Effect-Based Filtering on Mobile (Priority: P2)

A mobile user wants to discover terpenes based on therapeutic effects they're seeking, using an intuitive mobile-friendly filter interface that doesn't clutter the screen.

**Why this priority**: Filtering is a core discovery feature but secondary to basic browsing. Users must be able to browse before filtering becomes valuable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the filter interface via a floating action button, selecting effect categories without precision challenges, and seeing filtered results update in real-time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user views terpene list, **When** they look for filter access, **Then** a floating action button (FAB) is visible in bottom-right corner with filter icon and active filter count badge
2. **Given** user taps filter FAB, **When** bottom sheet opens, **Then** it slides up from bottom with drag handle visible and doesn't cover entire screen initially
3. **Given** filter bottom sheet is open, **When** user views filter options, **Then** effects are organized by categories (Mood/Energy, Cognitive, Relaxation, Physical) with clear visual separation
4. **Given** user selects effect filters, **When** they make selections, **Then** results count preview updates immediately showing "X terpenes match"
5. **Given** user applies filters, **When** bottom sheet closes, **Then** FAB badge shows active filter count and filtered results display in card grid
6. **Given** user wants to close filter sheet, **When** they swipe down on drag handle or tap outside sheet, **Then** sheet closes smoothly without applying changes
7. **Given** user has active filters, **When** they tap "Clear All" button, **Then** all filters reset and full terpene list displays

---

### User Story 3 - Mobile Navigation and Settings Access (Priority: P3)

A mobile user wants to access app settings, switch language, toggle theme, and navigate the app using a mobile-optimized header that doesn't waste precious screen space.

**Why this priority**: Essential for usability but less critical than core browsing and filtering features. Users need content access first, settings second.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the hamburger menu, navigating to settings, changing preferences, and verifying the interface responds appropriately on mobile viewports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens app on mobile, **When** they view the header, **Then** it displays hamburger menu (left), app logo (center), and settings icon (right) with all touch targets â‰¥ 44px
2. **Given** user taps hamburger menu, **When** navigation drawer opens, **Then** it slides in from left with app branding, navigation links, and language switcher clearly visible
3. **Given** user taps settings icon, **When** settings bottom sheet opens, **Then** theme toggle and language selector are accessible with large, easy-to-tap controls
4. **Given** user changes theme in settings, **When** they toggle dark mode, **Then** app transitions smoothly to dark theme within 200ms with no flash of unstyled content
5. **Given** user switches language, **When** they select German or English, **Then** all visible text updates immediately including terpene names, effects, and UI labels

---

### User Story 4 - Progressive Web App Installation (Priority: P4)

A mobile user wants to install the app to their home screen for quick access, use it offline when network is unavailable, and have a native app-like experience.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience significantly but requires core functionality to be working first. This is a retention and engagement feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering PWA install prompt, adding app to home screen, verifying offline functionality, and confirming service worker caching.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user visits app on supported mobile browser, **When** they interact for 30 seconds, **Then** browser may show install prompt (if browser supports it)
2. **Given** user installs PWA to home screen, **When** they launch from home screen icon, **Then** app opens in standalone mode without browser UI
3. **Given** user has app installed, **When** they lose network connection, **Then** previously viewed terpene data remains accessible with clear offline indicator
4. **Given** user is offline, **When** they attempt to access new data, **Then** appropriate offline message displays explaining limited functionality
5. **Given** app is installed, **When** user views splash screen on launch, **Then** branded splash screen displays with app icon and colors

---

### User Story 5 - Touch-Optimized Gestures and Interactions (Priority: P5)

A mobile user expects native app-like gestures such as pull-to-refresh, smooth scrolling, haptic feedback on interactions, and intuitive swipe gestures throughout the app.

**Why this priority**: Polish feature that significantly improves perceived quality but not essential for basic functionality. Enhances user delight after core features work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by performing swipe gestures, pull-to-refresh actions, and verifying haptic feedback on supported devices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is viewing terpene list, **When** they pull down from top of list, **Then** refresh animation appears and content reloads (even if data hasn't changed)
2. **Given** user opens detail modal, **When** they swipe down with moderate velocity, **Then** modal closes smoothly with physics-based animation
3. **Given** user taps interactive elements, **When** device supports haptics, **Then** subtle haptic feedback provides tactile confirmation
4. **Given** user scrolls through long content, **When** they scroll quickly, **Then** scroll momentum feels natural with smooth 60fps performance
5. **Given** user navigates between views, **When** transitions occur, **Then** animations respect prefers-reduced-motion setting for accessibility

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks

**RISK-001: Desktop Experience Degradation**
- **Impact**: High - Could alienate existing desktop users who represent 10% of target audience
- **Probability**: Medium - Shared components may introduce unintended side effects
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Create separate mobile-specific components where necessary
  - Implement comprehensive desktop regression testing suite
  - Use responsive design breakpoints to isolate mobile-only changes
  - Test desktop experience after each mobile component addition
  - Maintain desktop smoke tests in CI/CD pipeline

**RISK-002: Performance Target Failure**
- **Impact**: High - Poor performance defeats purpose of mobile optimization
- **Probability**: Medium - Ambitious performance targets with limited bundle size
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Establish performance budgets before development starts
  - Use bundle analyzer to monitor JavaScript/CSS size continuously
  - Implement code splitting for non-critical features
  - Profile components regularly during development
  - Use Lighthouse CI to catch performance regressions
  - Optimize images and lazy load non-critical assets

**RISK-003: Timeline Overrun**
- **Impact**: Medium - Budget impact and delayed value delivery
- **Probability**: Medium - Aggressive 3-week timeline with many requirements
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Follow strict phased delivery approach (Week 1: Foundation, Week 2: Enhancement, Week 3: Polish)
  - Focus on MVP for each phase
  - Build buffer time into estimates
  - Identify and defer nice-to-have features to future iterations
  - Daily progress tracking and early warning system
  - Maintain clear priority ordering (P1 must-haves vs P2-P5 enhancements)

### Medium Priority Risks

**RISK-004: Browser Compatibility Issues**
- **Impact**: Medium - Some users on older browsers cannot access mobile experience
- **Probability**: Low - Targeting modern browsers (2023+) reduces risk
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use progressive enhancement approach
  - Provide polyfills for critical features
  - Implement feature detection before using advanced APIs
  - Test across all target browsers early and often
  - Provide graceful fallbacks for unsupported features
  - Document browser compatibility clearly

**RISK-005: User Confusion with New Interface**
- **Impact**: Medium - Poor adoption if users don't understand new mobile patterns
- **Probability**: Low - Using standard mobile UI patterns reduces confusion
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use familiar mobile patterns (bottom sheets, FABs, swipe gestures)
  - Provide subtle visual hints for gesture-based interactions
  - Create optional onboarding tooltips for first-time mobile users
  - Conduct user testing with target audience
  - Monitor analytics for confusion signals (rapid exits, repeated actions)
  - Provide help documentation accessible from settings

**RISK-006: Gesture Discovery Issues**
- **Impact**: Low - Users may not discover gesture-based shortcuts
- **Probability**: Medium - Gestures are secondary interaction method
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Always provide button-based alternatives to gestures
  - Include subtle visual hints (drag handle on bottom sheet)
  - Add brief gesture tips in help section
  - Don't rely on gestures as only way to accomplish tasks
  - Use common gesture patterns users know from other apps
  - Track gesture usage analytics to measure discovery

**RISK-007: Accessibility Compliance Failure**
- **Impact**: High - Legal and ethical implications, excludes users
- **Probability**: Low - Clear WCAG guidelines and automated testing available
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Run automated accessibility tests (axe, Lighthouse) in CI/CD
  - Manual testing with screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack)
  - Ensure keyboard navigation works for all features
  - Test touch target sizes with real devices
  - Verify color contrast ratios during design phase
  - Consult WCAG 2.1 AA checklist throughout development

**RISK-008: PWA Installation Friction**
- **Impact**: Low - Reduced engagement if users don't install
- **Probability**: Medium - Browser install prompts are often ignored
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Provide clear value proposition for installation
  - Trigger install prompt at appropriate moment (not immediately)
  - Make app fully functional without installation
  - Don't repeatedly prompt if user declines
  - Monitor install rate and adjust strategy
  - Educate users on benefits (offline access, home screen)

### Low Priority Risks

**RISK-009: Service Worker Cache Issues**
- **Impact**: Low - Stale content or excessive storage usage
- **Probability**: Low - Established PWA patterns and tools available
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use Workbox for reliable caching strategies
  - Implement cache versioning and automatic cleanup
  - Set reasonable cache size limits
  - Provide manual cache clearing in settings
  - Monitor cache storage usage
  - Test update mechanisms thoroughly

**RISK-010: Animation Performance on Low-End Devices**
- **Impact**: Low - Reduced user experience on budget devices
- **Probability**: Low - Using GPU-accelerated properties
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Only animate transform and opacity properties
  - Respect prefers-reduced-motion setting
  - Test on older devices (2-3 years old)
  - Provide option to disable animations in settings
  - Use will-change CSS property judiciously
  - Profile animation performance regularly
