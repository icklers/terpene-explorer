      "definition": "Short for 'Cultivated Variety' - a group of cannabis plants that have been selectively bred and cultivated by humans to express specific characteristics and traits",
      "scientificAccuracy": "Botanically correct term for cannabis varieties",
      "characteristics": [
        "Result of intentional human breeding and selection",
        "Exhibits distinctive, stable, and reproducible traits",
        "Maintained through cloning (vegetative propagation) or stabilized seed breeding",

      "reproduction": "Offspring are genetically identical replicas when reproduced by cloning or vegetative cuts. For seed-based cultivars, requires several generations of backcrossing for stable offspring",

    "strain": {
      "definition": "Commonly used colloquial term in cannabis community to describe different varieties, but technically incorrect from a botanical perspective",
      "scientificAccuracy": "Not botanically accurate - 'strain' is properly used in microbiology/virology for bacteria, viruses, and fungi, not plants",
      "relationship": "Often used interchangeably with 'cultivar' in popular cannabis culture, though 'cultivar' is more scientifically precise",
      "note": "While widely understood and still commonly used, the industry is shifting toward using 'cultivar' for botanical accuracy and scientific legitimacy",
      "whyIncorrect": "In biology, 'strain' refers to genetic variants of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi), not plants"

    "variety": {
      "definition": "A taxonomic rank below species - refers to natural adaptations of cannabis due to environmental factors without human intervention",
      "scientificAccuracy": "Botanically correct but refers to natural variants, not human-cultivated ones",
      "characteristics": [
        "Natural adaptation without human intervention",

        "Type I: THC-dominant, CBD <0.3%",
